# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, including labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments` with appropriate label and state filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply/remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically inside the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

GitHub shares one number space across issues and pull requests. Resolve an ambiguous `#42` with `gh pr view 42`, then fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: an issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding Notes, Decisions-so-far, and Fog.
- **Child ticket**: a GitHub sub-issue linked to the map. If sub-issues are unavailable, use a task list and add `Part of #<map>` to the child.
- **Labels**: `wayfinder:<type>`, where type is `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, or `task`.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub's native issue dependencies. If unavailable, add a `Blocked by: #<n>` line to the child.
- **Frontier query**: choose the first open, unblocked, unassigned child in map order.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the child, and append a context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
